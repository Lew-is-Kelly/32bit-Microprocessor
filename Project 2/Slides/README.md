# Heads up!
The naming convention used in these documents is strange as thats how they were provided. There is a total of 3 'seperate' projects however the last is built ontop of the second one. The first is either referred to as "Project A", the second is either referred to as "Project 1" or "Project 1 Part B" or "Project AB". The third is either "Project ABC" or "Project 2".
- Yes this is confusing and I hate it, however I can't change it.
